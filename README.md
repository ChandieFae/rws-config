RWS for JSON StorageAccessApi
The related-website-set.json file is a declarative file that tells browsers (especially Chrome) which domains are part of the same organizational group â€” so that certain restricted cross-site features like cookie access can still be enabled without violating privacy boundaries.

It supports the transition away from third-party cookies by allowing limited and privacy-respecting storage access across a small group of trusted domains.

This file is typically hosted on a public domain, submitted to Google for review, and used by Chrome to allow certain storage-related exceptions across listed domains.
